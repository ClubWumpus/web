__Public Statement__ (Why CheeseCast left the project)

Hi there,

I've decided to completely abandon ship. This project took it out on me both emotionally and mentally and I cannot keep up the project anymore. The project will stay alive until October 2017 so you can still play the awesome games we created. Now that the story is over, the server just feels lost. Like almost in a VOID. The character, Cheese, wasn't far off from my own real self. I just hope you understand why I've had to cut ties.

I just hope people understand that I put so much work into something I'm truly passionate about. I did this all for the Discord community. Most of the art/social media/games were built from the ground up. We all did this together and for that I'm greatful.

Enjoy the games that are currently on there. I cannot continue this project anymore. Please do not go out of your way to attack anyone either. The project just wasn't going right and the story wasn't far off to myself. But please, do not leave any ill will in the server. Like I have said multiple times, the community can continue its legacy. I just do not have time to continue it. This isn't some storyline or plot either. There was some terrible things that went on behind-the-scenes and I cannot continue it anymore.

Please remember the awesome memes we shared together. "The Wumpiverse" is also available to download for FREE. I cannot continue this anymore. It's been a tough journey and I hope you understand that I was just trying to tell my story in a creative, unique way.

I hope you understand.

Best,

Jordan

P.S: I've now handed this project over to the community. They will be continuing the project.
